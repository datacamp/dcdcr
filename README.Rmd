This package contains utilities to work with DataCamp Data Connector. It is designed to be used by administrators and managers of DataCamp groups. Some 
prior experience of writing reports with R is recommended.

## Installation

You can install the development version with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace('remotes', quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("datacamp/dcdcr")
```

## Getting Started

Before you begin, you need to enable Data Connector in your DataCamp group, and 
set S3 credentials as environment variables, as described in this [this Support article](https://support.datacamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405070893591-DataCamp-Data-Connector-A-Step-by-Step-Configuration-Guide-for-Automated-Data-Exports).
If in doubt, speak to your Customer Success Manager.

## Accessing Data

You can access any of the tables in the data connector by initializing it using the `data_connector` function and using autocomplete to access all the tables.

By default the connector is set up to access data for the latest date. However,
you can also pass a `date` argument to `dc_data_connector` to initialize it to access data for a specific date. This is useful when you want to create reports
and want to pin your analysis to data as on a specific date.

```{r example}
library(dcdcr)
dc <- data_connector()
dc$tbl_assessment_dim()
```

You can also print the documentation for each table by accessing the function
using autocomplete, but NOT invoking it.

```{r eval = FALSE}
dc$tbl_assessment_dim
```

All the data accessors are memoized and will cache the results in memory when 
they are run for the first time. This should speed up analysis considerably 
since the data is already cached in memory.
